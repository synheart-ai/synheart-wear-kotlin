## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-15

First public release. Adds Fitbit + Oura cloud providers to reach
parity with the Flutter/Swift siblings, modernizes the build for
AGP 9 / Gradle 9.2 / Kotlin 2.3, ships a Compose example app and a
`/docs/` scaffold, and contracts the public API surface for
long-term stability.

### Added
- **FitbitProvider** and **OuraProvider** — cloud OAuth + data fetch
  via the vendor-templated Retrofit endpoints on `WearServiceAPI`.
  Both implement `WearableProvider`. New `OURA` case on
  `DeviceAdapter`. Wired into `SynheartWear` via `fitbit` / `oura`
  accessors and `getProvider(FITBIT|OURA)`. MockK tests for both.
- README "Documentation" section links to the central Mintlify
  docs site at <https://docs.synheart.ai/synheart-wear/kotlin> —
  single source of truth shared with the Swift / Flutter siblings.
- `/example-app/` — Jetpack Compose Android demo wired as a Gradle
  subproject (`include(":example-app")` in `settings.gradle.kts`).
- `auto-tag-release.yml` workflow — push to `release` branch reads
  `VERSION_NAME` and tags `vX.Y.Z`, mirroring `synheart-auth-kotlin`.
- `readMetricsFromProvider` now handles `GARMIN`, `FITBIT`, `OURA`,
  `BLE_HRM` (previously fell through to "not yet implemented" for
  every provider except `WHOOP` and `HEALTH_CONNECT`).

### Changed
- **Build modernized for AGP 9.0 / Gradle 9.2 / Kotlin 2.3.**
  protobuf plugin `0.9.6` → `0.10.0` (the earlier version hit the
  removed `BaseExtension` API). Hoisted
  `com.android.application` + `kotlin.plugin.compose` to root with
  `apply false`. Wired protobuf-generated `java/kotlin/grpc/grpckt`
  output into `android.sourceSets.main` and added the `java` builtin
  so lite Kotlin messages compile. Added
  `io.grpc:grpc-protobuf-lite:1.62.2`. `:example-app` uses
  `coreLibraryDesugaring` to match the parent AAR.
- **`RamenClient.kt`** updated for `option java_multiple_files = true`
  proto layout and replaced the removed
  `MetadataUtils.attachHeaders(stub, metadata)` with
  `stub.withInterceptors(MetadataUtils.newAttachHeadersInterceptor(...))`.
- **`CloudConfig.baseUrl` default normalized** from a typo'd Render
  staging URL (`synheart-wear-service-leatest.onrender.com`) to the
  canonical `https://api.synheart.ai/wear`. Test URLs across four
  files normalized to the same value.
- **Public API surface contracted** for first OSS release:
  `WearServiceAPI`, `WearAdapter`, `Normalizer`, `HeartRateParser`,
  the entire `cloud.models` package (17 wire-level data classes),
  and the Ramen types (`RamenClient`, `RamenConfig`, `RamenEvent`,
  `RamenConnectionState`) are now `internal`. Cloud providers
  (Whoop / Garmin / Fitbit / Oura) refactored to internal-primary
  + public-secondary constructor pattern so the public ctor no
  longer exposes the now-internal `WearServiceAPI`.
- **`GarminHealth`** stub methods now throw `SynheartWearException`
  pointing at `GARMIN_SETUP.md` instead of silently returning
  `emptyFlow()` / `emptyList()` when the licensed native binary is
  absent.

### Removed
- **`CloudWearableAdapter`** and **`getCloudAdapter()`** — parallel
  duplicate of the per-vendor providers. Cloud sources in
  `readMetrics()` route through each per-vendor provider directly
  via a small `pullLatest()` helper.
- **`WearSession`** — declared but only referenced by its own test;
  zero production callers.

### Fixed
- `HealthConnectAdapter` no longer emits actual biometric values
  (HR / HRV / steps / calories / distance) to logcat at `Log.d`;
  log lines now carry only counts/units, in line with the SDK's
  own privacy guidance.
- `SynheartWearConfigTest` adapter-count assertion updated from
  6 → 7 to reflect the new `OURA` enum case.
- `.gitignore` rules `docs/` and `*.md` removed (they had blocked
  `git add docs/` and orphaned `GARMIN_SETUP.md` from the working
  tree since May 7); `GARMIN_SETUP.md` now committed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Health Connect integration for unified biometric data access on Android.
- Cloud wearable adapters (WHOOP, Garmin, Fitbit) via Synheart Wear Service.

### Changed
- Updated build tooling (Android Gradle Plugin 8.2.x, Kotlin 1.9.x).

### Fixed
- Various stability improvements and test coverage updates.
